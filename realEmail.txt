Hi Everyone, 

We will be holding a review session on 5.4.21 at 6 AM if anyone would like to join. If you would like to attend the session, please RSVP with
your UCCS account. Though this is not mandetory, and rather early in the morning, it is highly recommended you join to be prepared for the final. 
Good luck with your last few weeks of the semester. 

Dr. Theg
